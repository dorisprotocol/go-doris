  <h1 class="title">What is Doris?</h1>

  <p>Doris is a service for sharing images, videos, and other files.</p>

  <p>
    On Doris, only <i>you</i> can upload files. You can share links to those
    files with anyone, and they never have to sign up for an account.
  </p>

  <p>Doris puts you fully in control, which means:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You can share direct download links without forcing your guests to see ads
      or prompts to sign up for an account.
    </li>
    <li>There are no restrictions on file type, size, or content.</li>
    <li>Doris never resizes or re-encodes your media files.</li>
    <li>
      Doris preserves the original filename and metadata for your files.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Doris is easy to self-host. See our
    <a href="https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare">source repo</a> for details.
